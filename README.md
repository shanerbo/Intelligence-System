Part I

### Choose a problem from the five problems from Section 12 of the course notes, "Representing Problems: Examples from the 2015 LP/CP Programming Competition". Further information on these problems can be found on the 2015 LP/CP Programming Contest web page.
#### Choose a solver from the following:
##### MiniZinc
##### The IDP System
##### Minion
#### Spend some time looking at the tutorial or manual of each solver, and some sample problem specifications, to see which one you are most comfortable with.
#### Create a problem specification and set of test instances:
#### Write a problem specification in your chosen system language for your chosen problem.
#### Generate a set of test instances (an absolute minimum of 10 -- for a decision problem 5 satisfiable and 5 unsatisfiable) to help debug specifications for your problem. (You will submit these as part of your project. Try to make them good.)
#### Test your specification for correctness as throughoughly as you can. Use the instances from the contest web page, your own set (see previous item), and others that you may devise to help.
#### Submit, to Coursys, a .zip file of the contents of a directory containing (at least) a short report (.pdf format please), your specification, and your test instances. The report should:
#### Be (for most people) around 2 pages, depending on the length of your specification, choice of test instances, and sizes of your data tables;
#### State your choice of problem and solver system, whether you worked on the decision or optimization version of the problem, and any other decisions or assumptions you made;
#### Give your problem specification.
#### Describe your test instances: how many, how you obtained or constructed them, the rationale behind your choices, and anything else interesting about them;
#### Your settings for parameters of the solver (including saying that you used all default settings, if that is the case);
#### One or more tables of the results (run times, cost function values) of running the solver on your test instances.
